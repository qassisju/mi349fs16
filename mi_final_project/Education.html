        From 2009-2013, I attended Detroit Catholic Central High School in Novi, MI.
        Upon graduiaton of high school, I spent a year at Schoolcraft College in Livonia, MI, where
        I took some prerequisite courses. After a year, I applied and was accepted to MSU.

    <p id="WorkInfo">
        I have had a job ever since I was 16. I started out working at a few fast food jobs before I got
        an opportunity to work at a local pharmacy in my hometown of Westland MI. When I came to Michigan State,
        I immediately secured a job at the Division of Engineering Computing Services in the College of Engineering,
        where I currently work now. I have also had two internships with Quicken Loans in Downtown Detroit, MI, Fortune's 5th best company to
        work for in 2016. My first internship was an IT support internship, while my second one focused on software
        engineering!.
