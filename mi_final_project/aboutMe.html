<p>
    My name is Justin Qassis and I am a currently a senior at Michigan State University.
    I am currently studying Media and Information Technology with a minor in Information
    Technology as well. I am 21 years old, and have been born and raised in Michigan my whole
    life. I grew up and still reside in the city of Westland, MI. Some of the
    things I love to do include sports and working with computers. I have been an avid sports
    fan my entire life. My favorite sports to play are golf, football, and basketball.
    I like to watch all sports, but my favorites are golf, hockey, basketball(college and NBA), and football(both college
    and NFL)
